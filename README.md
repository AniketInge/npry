# Inspired by Pry for Ruby, Built with <3 for Node.JS

This is a first cut of Ruby's [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) like utility built specifically for Node.js. It's a REPL with basic features such as listing the module loaded (multi-module support coming soon!) & evaluating the module contents in the REPL.

Honestly, I am still learning Node.JS and thought what better way to learn than create a project in Node, and still help Node developers.

I request all the great, way-more-smarter-than-me people on GitHub to help me build a cool Pry-Clone for Node.JS.

What's exciting? We might end up being better than Pry :-) (long shot, but still worth a try)
